LAWS OF UX:
-----------
-----------



JAKOB: 
------

	- Jakob's LAW: Users spend most of their time on other sites, and they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

		+ Ecommerce sites like Etsy leverage preexisting mental models to keep customers focused on purchasing products rather than on learning new interaction patterns

		+ In contrast, failure to consider the mental model a user has formed can result in confusion and frustration

		+ thereâ€™s certainly a time and a place for innovation



FITT:
-----

	- FITT's LAW:  The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

		+ Navigation should be painless and straightforward, requiring minimal effort.
		+ as the size of the object increases, the time to reach it goes down.
		+ The spacing between interactive elements is also an important consideration.
		+ 

HICK:
-----

	- HICK's LAW: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices available.

		+ Minimiza the choices when response time is critical
		+ Break complex tasks into smaller steps to decrease cognitive load.
		+ Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting recommended options
		+ Use Profressive onboarding 
		+ be careful not to simplfy to the point of abstraction
		+ Instead of dropping users into a fully featured app after subjecting them to a few onboarding slides


MILLER:
-------


	- Miller's Law:the average person can only keep 7 (+-2) items in their working memory.
		
		+ Organize content into smaller chunks to help users process and memorize
		+ Short term memory is variable (assume trash, hope for perfect)
		+
