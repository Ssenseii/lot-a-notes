Designing and Prototyping:
--------------------------
--------------------------

	- Figma is composed of Design and Figjams
	- Research and Analytics in design is the first step
		+ Gathering and analyzing data using Figjam
		+ Creating a moodboard
		+ functional user flow with Figjam tools

	- Devoting a significant time to research
	
Design Research: 
----------------
	1. Mission Statement is the first thing to highlight.
		(Look up Google's, Facebook's, Apple's, Ikea's)
	2. Competitor Research and Analysis.
		+ Functionalities
		+ Design patterns
		+ Conventions	
		+ Negatives
	
	how to study competitors: 
		+ Take screenshots
		+ Exploring products
		+ Noting interesting solutions
		+ collecting own notes and comments
		
	Moodboard: 
		+ Anything that is getting your attention
		+ Pinterest is your best friend (behance too)
		+ feel free to add whatever
	
	User Personas: 
		+ Define a target
		+ Who is this product for?
		+ Interview and poll
		+ Create Fictional Descriptions of Users
		+ Use it as Guideline
		+ Don't trust your intuition
		+ Use Empirical methods based on data
		+ Careless User definition leads to project failure
		+ Persona must include: Needs, Goals and Frustrations
		+ Persona should never represent people you know



USER FLOW :
-----------

	- UX is far closer to marketing and psychology
	- Understnading your user and analyzing their behavior
	- Be the user
	- ALWAYS remember the purpose of the product and whom it serves


Notes:
------

	- Don't Design an interface until you know the content.
	- without real content, there is always a risk of creating a beautiful container that is unsuitable for placing the final data in
	- Request a demo sample of the display data (in our case, create one but not artificially)
	


WIREFRAMING A MOBILE EXPERIENCE:
--------------------------------

	- moving from theory and hypotheses to creating a real application structure using the wireframe method!

Why wireframe?
--------------

	- takes place before the prototype design
	- wireframing is a crucial part of the process 
	- A designer's job is mostly about research, analysis, and problem-solving rather than creativity


	- Wireframe: It's the first draft pf a raw UI without any style, detail or color.
	- Done with Pen and Paper (at times: figma)
	- if you skip wireframing: problems reveal themselves at the final product.
	- The essential meaning of this part is to make sure the flow you came up with during the UX design phase is the best one for your user	
	
Why mobile first?
----------------

	- Choose the smallest format (usually mobile)
	- People use their phones more than they use their desktop PCs
	- grainy, low-quality images should be absolutely avoided in production



DESINGING CONSISTENTLY USING GRIDS, COLORS and TYPOGRAPHY:
----------------------------------------------------------
	
	- A good designer will not let personal taste affect a product.
	- design must be done with precision
 	- No longer working with random frame sizes

GRIDS: 
	- Shift + R: Activate Rulers in figma
	- 12 cell layout?
