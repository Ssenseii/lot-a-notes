VISITOR PATTERN:
----------------

	- Behavioral Pattern
	- Seperate the algorithm from the object the algorithm is working on

roles:
	
	- The visitor interface: set of operations that can be performed on an object
	- The concrete visitor classes: implement the visitor interface and provide specific implementations on the operations
	- The cisitable ibjects: define a method that accepts a visitor and invokes the appropriate operation on the visitor
