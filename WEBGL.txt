WEBGL: 
-----

	- 3D API
	- Draws points, lines and triangles 
	- Code is in the form of a pair functions written in GLSL.	
		+ Vertex Shader
		+ Fragment Shader
	- Together they are called a: Program
	- VS computes vertex positions
	- FS compute the color for each pixel
	
	- The 4 ways a shader can receive data: 
		
	1. Vertex Arrays, Attributes and Buffers
		+ Buffers: Arrays of binary data, can contain positions, normals, texture coordinates...
		+ Attributes: pull data from buffers and provide to VS.
	2. Uniforms: Global Variables you set before executing your program.
	3. Textures: Arrays of data that contain whatever you want them to (image data, colors)
	4. Varyings: A way for VS to pass data to a FS
