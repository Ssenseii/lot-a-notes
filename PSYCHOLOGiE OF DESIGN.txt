PSCYHOLOGIE OF DESIGN:
----------------------

	- The more you know about people the better the experience you will be able to design
	
	- You'll Learn:
		+ What grabs attention
		+ What errors people make?
		+ Other things that'll help you design.


- HOW PEOPLE SEE?

	- What your brain is seeing isn't what your eyes are seeing.
	- What you think people are going to see when you design a product may or may not be what they actually see
	- People canâ€™t help but notice movement in their peripheral vision.
